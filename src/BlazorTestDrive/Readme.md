# BlazorTestDrive

The test drive page is a Blazor WebAssembly app which runs in the client browser and allows the user to try out various TOML configurations with their data files.

The idea is to give feedback as quickly as possible in order to help guide a customer to a correct configuration, before they upload incorrect data into AQTS.

More info on the test drive page is found [here on the wiki](https://github.com/AquaticInformatics/tabular-field-data-plugin/wiki/BlazorTestDrive).
